The discord bot was a bot made to create convenience for those using the Discord application in order to execute certain commands such as playing music in a group wide call, organize the server, and for ease of giving FAQ information to users in the server.

The discord bot was made using a source code from [Just-Some-Bots](https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot) to grab a better understanding of how to create a bot. Using the borrowed source code to learn how to create a personal bot, able to create a personal bot for the my personal discord server. 

In this project, I gained an understanding on how python worked at a very basic level to understand how a type of bots were made on discord. I have also learned a basics of creating a responsive bot to take in commands and execute the command through a given chatting platform.
