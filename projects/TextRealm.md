TextRealm is an interactive website that allows the user to freely buy and sell textbooks from each other instead of processing purchases from the bookstore. The application allows the user to search for books to purchase and rate other users.

The search page allows to search for any exisiting text books based on title, author, ISBN-10, cost, and condition. The user may also post a textbook to sell giving the information listed prior, a cover picture, condition, and any notes for the selling text book. The rating system allows for the user to rate other users based on their quality and trustability when purchasing a book from those users. This site does not allow a direct purchase through the site, meaning the site will allow the users to contact each other for their purchase on their own terms.

This project was a collaborative group project to create a interactive website based on a prompt. My contributions for the projects includes, the sign up and login page allowing users to create and keep an account on the website, base UI design fixes, and the fixup of our [Description page](https://textrealm.github.io/).
