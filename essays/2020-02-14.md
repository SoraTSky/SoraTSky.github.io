*Doing the right thing goes a long way*

## Standards are necessary

I personally think that the coding standards are necessary when it comes to programming. I think that the coding standards help in several ways other than just making code look nice. 

Coding standards are put in place to make code little more readable for people to read. Especially for other people to look at your code and even more so, yourself when you come back to the code. Having a common knowledge on the standards of code makes it so that when referenced or being used, applied, whatever it is, the code is more understandable than just a wall of text. These standards also in a way help how to think about code. Especially with indents and all the different separations like curly brackets and braces, these are to establish what part of code is trying to establish what. These are similar to commas, dash, and period in actual sentences used for normal languages. There are minute details that do help in a very unnoticed way which allows for any programmer to understand how to write and how to read code more efficiently.

## The ESLint checks

To be completely honest, I think ESLint is just another one of the code styles that is implemented just for standards followed by several different people. They are very similar to other checks that are out there. Though for different types of languages there has to be different types of spell checks and auto corrects necessary to compensate for those languages. ESLint was just one of those spell checks that you’d use while you are writing because you make mistakes like everybody else does especially when writing some “liek this”. I still think that this is very helpful in most situations when I don’t remember the correct spelling. Having this kind of check while writing code to help you find a missing semicolon goes a long way.
